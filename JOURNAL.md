## 10/20/2025 - Researching Shape  

Allo!

First Journal (I hope I'm doing this correctly). To start off, I'm refining how I want this to look.

So at first I actually wanted to make this an arcade machine clock. While that's definitely a future variation I want to make, I think pulling down a lever would be a satisfying way of shutting it up.
As it turns out, I have a mini arcade machine at home!

It's already a pretty nice size, so I quickly made a couple of measurements just for CAD reference later

The only thing I'm noticing is that its pretty light. If I slap a lever in the morning it will probably slam face first into my night stand. So I'll prob have the bottom compartment be filled with sand? Or concrete like that DIY lathe that did rounds on youtube.

Now design wise, I wanna mix the colorful high octane modern style with the feel of an old timey machine (remember the lever?). So these images were inspirations personally:

_Nice Lever! Maybe I'll add rubber for mine. The font is definitely something to replicate_

_The double screen does look nice. Although would up the cost..._

_A very colorful combination of the two, probably the most similar to what I aim to make_

Hopefully you kind of have a picture of the physical shape. Ofc subject to change, but this is hopefully what it'll look like. Cya Later!
